# blinking
Blinking is a small plugin I made to implement blinking into Minecraft by using the blindness effect already implemented into the game.
- Requires your server to support Spigot plugins.
- Requires the primary version of your server to be 1.20 as that will likely be the only release made for this.

Just like real life!
*This was made as a joke but it is functional.*
